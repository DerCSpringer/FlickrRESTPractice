# An example of the core concepts of iOS development

This app is meant to be an example of the core concepts needed to develop iOS apps. It is a simple two screen app that presents a list retrieved from Flickr in JSON of the top places where photographs haven been taken recently.  The data is displayed in a table view.  A location may be selected which presents a scroll view with a picture displayed from the location.  The list of locations along with some other data is stored in Core Data.
**Although simple, the app covers the following concepts of iOS development:**

* the MVC pattern
* view controllers and their lifecycle
* the view hierarchy
* storyboards
* nibs
* basics of Auto Layout
* outlets and the target-action pattern
* communication between view controllers and delegation
* protocols
* REST api calls
* correct use of background thread(for network calls) and main thread(to update ui)
* use of delegation to avoid strong reference cycles
* Core Data
